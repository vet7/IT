      <h2>Why IT?</h2>
      <br>
      <p style='text-align: justify'>
        I am interested in IT because it is an industry that is fast, innovative, dynamic and progressive. Having the option to travel, work and live remotely is also particularly appealing. While I am unable to pinpoint when my interest in IT began, it has always been an intrinsic interest of mine as I like to both problem-solve and explore new ways of doing things. While I currently have little experience in this field, my plan for the next few years is to accumulate as much knowledge and skills as I can so that I am able to make my contribution to this industry. For this reason, I am now enrolled at the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT).
      </p>
      <p style='text-align: justify'>
        I chose to study at the RMIT via Open Universities Australia because it was one of the few universities that allows students to study and complete a Bachelor of Information Technology online. Giving students the option to complete our studies online is great because it adapts to our schedules and allows us the freedom to study from anywhere in the world. I also like that RMIT encourages us to self-learn without the strict learning format more traditional universities tend to adopt.
      </p>
      <p style='text-align: justify'>
        During my studies I expect to learn the theory fundamental to the field of IT, interpersonal and practical skills essential for working in a team, as well as the technical skills associated with programming, data analytics and design. While not all of this is new to me, I believe there is always something new to learn and that there is always room for constant improvement. As such, the fascination with new knowledge, skills and ideas is what brought me to study IT.

      <h2>Software Developer</h2>
      <br>
      <p style='text-align: justify'>
        While doing a job search online, I came across Learnlife, a team working together towards reimagining the concept of learning (Learnlife 2021). They advertised that they were in need of someone to join them as a full-stack developer.
      </p>
      <p style='text-align: justify'>
        There are three distinctive reasons why this advertisement and position listed are appealing to me. First and foremost, they value growth, respect, integrity and creativity. Second, as they are driven towards reconceptualising education to support life-long learning. Third, the position gives me the freedom to choose where I wish to work, as well the opportunity to work with people globally.
      </p>
      <h4><i>Skills, Qualifications, Experience</i></h4>
      <p style='text-align: justify'>
        While many job advertisements require full-stack developer applicants to have obtained a bachelor’s in computer science or equivalent, this advertisement states that you must have had experience working in a similar web-based developer role. They expect the applicant to be adept at the programming languages – Ruby and JavaScript – as well as being able to work independently, be able to problem-solve, as well as the ability to work well with others in a team.
      </p>
      <p style='text-align: justify'>
        Of equal importance, they have requested a set of values of which strongly align with mine: wishing to build positive connections; being empathetic to others and others’ ideas; the willingness to grow individually and as a community; the ability to see yourself having fun in the role; and to have a strong sense of justice and authenticity.
      </p>
      <p style='text-align: justify'>
        I can also see myself applying for this role as, from my experiences as a student and employee, when in need of help, I generally prefer guidance rather than answers. As for teamwork, all my previous work experience heavily rely on working together to achieve a goal. I highly value getting together and discussing ideas because I believe that if we all put our minds together, we are better able to create something extraordinary as well as viable.
      </p>
      <p style='text-align: justify'>
        Practically speaking though, currently I have little to no technical experience in order to apply for this role, though I plan to gather as much knowledge, skills and experience as possible in the next few years. Before anything else, I plan to complete a Bachelor in IT. Whilst at university I also plan to learn, and become at least comfortable using, Java, as well as other programming languages not specifically taught in our program such as C#. In my second or third year at university, depending on my abilities, I will search for suitable internships so that I can apply what I have learnt and gain some experience.
      </p>
      <h4><i>Reflection</i></h4>
      <p style='text-align: justify'>
        I acknowledge that I have quite a lot of learning and experience ahead of me before I am able to do what I would truly love to do, however I am thankful to have started this journey and I am genuinely excited about all the possibilities offered in the field of IT.

      <h2>MBTI, Big-Five & Learning Styles</h2>
      <br>
      <p style='text-align: justify'>
        I think these personality tests are useful if we view them as a guideline for where we might wish to improve. However, it may be somewhat of a dangerous tool if used to box people into types to justify individual preferences and behaviour, whether it’d be others’ or my own. In saying that, I had done the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator a while ago and got the same result, my natural and preferred state is an ENFP. However, over the years I have worked really hard at being more structured, especially with study and work, and I think that is more apparent in the Big-Five scores. As for learning styles I think I am fairly balanced, although it seems that I tend towards being able to apply what I have learnt in a practical sense.
      </p>
      <h4><i>How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?</i></h4>
      <p style='text-align: justify'>
        Although in my personal life I prefer doing things on a whim and find routine tasks a bit monotonous, incorporating more practical strategies, especially in the context of university and work, have been greatly useful and have helped me achieve many personal goals. It has also helped me to better understand what others’ value and other communication styles. I do believe that not one of us will ever be perfect and that we will always have room to grow. I am always keen to learn from others’, especially from those with more experience.
      </p>
      <h4><i>How should you take this into account when forming a team?</i></h4>
      <p style='text-align: justify'>
        Teams work best when structured around similar values though differ in terms of ideas, skills and abilities. A good balance of our differences is key to team effectiveness. If we harness individual strengths and weaknesses and distribute work fairly based on this, we will be able to achieve much more together than if we had to work at the same project alone. As long as there is the motivation and the respect, I don’t see how conflicting ideas could be anything but positive, especially since we have the opportunity to adopt useful attributes and skills from each other. Every one of us has potential, and each of us has something to learn, thus this can only be seen as beneficial.

      <h2>Project Idea</h2>
      <br>
      <h4><i>Overview</i></h4>
      <p style='text-align: justify'>
        Imagine an instant food delivery system applied to online shopping. My project idea is to create a mobile application to support a service that streamlines the delivery of online purchases directly to consumers. As an online shopper, you will be able to purchase items, such as clothes, stationery, bathroom essentials and other easy-to-package products, from select stores around your area and someone will be able to deliver this to you within the hour.
      </p>
      <h4><i>Motivation</i></h4>
      <p style='text-align: justify'>
        While many of us already use food and liquor delivery services, there is a shortage of courier services offering the same for online shopping. Even in terms of existing courier services, these usually take at least three hours to deliver. It appears that whilst online shopping trends have taken off, delivery services are still in need of catching up.
