      <h4><i>A bit about me:</i></h4>
      <p style='text-align: justify'>
        I was born in the United States and raised in Australia. As both my parents are Taiwanese, my native language is english and I can also understand and speak basic mandarin. I have previously completed a Diploma in Communication & Media and have recently transferred from a Bachelor of Design in Architecture to a Bachelor in Information Technology. In my spare time I love to surf, hike, travel, hang out at gigs, and read. My best buddy is Kaya, she’s a border-collie cross kelpie and the only thing preventing me from writing too much about her is that I am being assessed on this.

      <h2>Why IT?</h2>
      <br>
      <p style='text-align: justify'>
        I am interested in IT because it is an industry that is fast, innovative, dynamic and progressive. Having the option to travel, work and live remotely is also particularly appealing. While I am unable to pinpoint when my interest in IT began, it has always been an intrinsic interest of mine as I like to both problem-solve and explore new ways of doing things. While I currently have little experience in this field, my plan for the next few years is to accumulate as much knowledge and skills as I can so that I am able to make my contribution to this industry. For this reason, I am now enrolled at the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT).
      </p>
      <p style='text-align: justify'>
        I chose to study at the RMIT via Open Universities Australia because it was one of the few universities that allows students to study and complete a Bachelor of Information Technology online. Giving students the option to complete our studies online is great because it adapts to our schedules and allows us the freedom to study from anywhere in the world. I also like that RMIT encourages us to self-learn without the strict learning format more traditional universities tend to adopt.
      </p>
      <p style='text-align: justify'>
        During my studies I expect to learn the theory fundamental to the field of IT, interpersonal and practical skills essential for working in a team, as well as the technical skills associated with programming, data analytics and design. While not all of this is new to me, I believe there is always something new to learn and that there is always room for constant improvement. As such, the fascination with new knowledge, skills and ideas is what brought me to study IT.

      <h2>Software Developer</h2>
      <br>
      <p style='text-align: justify'>
        While doing a job search online, I came across Learnlife, a team working towards reimagining the concept of learning (Learnlife 2021). They advertised that they were in need of someone to join them as a full-stack developer (<a href="https://weworkremotely.com/remote-jobs/learnlife-full-stack-developer-ruby-javascript" target="_blank">to view the listing click here</a>).
      </p>
      <br>
      <div id="jobadvert">
      <img src="jobadvert.png" alt="jobadvert"/>
      </div>
      <br>
      <p style='text-align: justify'>
        There are three distinctive reasons why this advertisement and position listed are appealing to me. First and foremost, they value growth, respect, integrity and creativity. Second, as they are driven towards reconceptualising education to support life-long learning. Third, the position gives me the freedom to choose where I wish to work, as well the opportunity to work with people globally.
      </p>
      <h4><i>Skills, Qualifications, Experience</i></h4>
      <p style='text-align: justify'>
        While many job advertisements require full-stack developer applicants to have obtained a bachelor’s in computer science or equivalent, this advertisement states that you must have had experience working in a similar web-based developer role. They expect the applicant to be adept at the programming languages – Ruby and JavaScript – as well as being able to work independently, be able to problem-solve, as well as the ability to work well with others in a team.
      </p>
      <p style='text-align: justify'>
        Of equal importance, they have requested a set of values of which strongly align with mine: wishing to build positive connections; being empathetic to others and others’ ideas; the willingness to grow individually and as a community; the ability to see yourself having fun in the role; and to have a strong sense of justice and authenticity.
      </p>
      <p style='text-align: justify'>
        I can also see myself applying for this role as, from my experiences as a student and employee, when in need of help, I generally prefer guidance rather than answers. As for teamwork, all my previous work experience heavily rely on working together to achieve a goal. I highly value getting together and discussing ideas because I believe that if we all put our minds together, we are better able to create something extraordinary as well as viable.
      </p>
      <p style='text-align: justify'>
        Practically speaking though, currently I have little to no technical experience in order to apply for this role, though I plan to gather as much knowledge, skills and experience as possible in the next few years. Before anything else, I plan to complete a Bachelor in IT. Whilst at university I also plan to learn and become at least comfortable using Java, as well as other programming languages not specifically taught in our program such as C#. In my second or third year at university, depending on my abilities, I will search for suitable internships so that I can apply what I have learnt and gain some experience.
      </p>
      <h4><i>Reflection</i></h4>
      <p style='text-align: justify'>
        I acknowledge that I have quite a lot of learning and experience ahead of me before I am able to do what I would truly love to do, however I am thankful to have started this journey and I am genuinely excited about all the possibilities offered in the field of IT.

      </div>
      <h4><i>What do the results of these tests mean for you?</i></h4>
      <p style='text-align: justify'>
        I think personality tests are useful if we view them as a guideline for where we might wish to improve. However, it may be somewhat of a dangerous tool if used to box people into types to justify individual preferences and behaviour, whether towards others or myself. In saying that, I had done the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator a while ago and got the same result, my natural and preferred state is an ENFP. However, over the years I have worked really hard at being more structured, especially with study and work, and I think that is more apparent in the Big-Five scores. As for learning styles I think I am fairly balanced, although it seems that I tend towards being able to apply what I have learnt in a practical sense.
      </p>
      <h4><i>How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?</i></h4>
      <p style='text-align: justify'>
        Although in my personal life I prefer doing things on a whim and find routine tasks a bit monotonous, incorporating more practical strategies, especially in the context of university and work, have been greatly useful and have helped me achieve many personal goals. It has also helped me to better understand what others’ value and other communication styles. I do believe that not one of us will ever be perfect and that we will always have room to grow. I am always keen to learn from others, especially from those with more experience.
      </p>
      <h4><i>How should you take this into account when forming a team?</i></h4>
      <p style='text-align: justify'>
        Teams work best when structured around similar values though differ in terms of ideas, skills and abilities. A good balance of our differences is key to team effectiveness. If we harness individual strengths and weaknesses and distribute work fairly based on this, we will be able to achieve much more together than if we had to work at the same project alone. As long as there is the motivation and the respect, I don’t see how conflicting ideas could be anything but positive, particularly since we have the opportunity to adopt useful attributes and skills from each other. Every one of us has potential, and each of us has something to learn, thus this can only be seen as beneficial.

      </span>

    </div>

    <section class="section section-dark">
      <h2>Project Idea</h2>
      <br>
      <h4><i>Overview</i></h4>
      <p style='text-align: justify'>
        Imagine an instant food delivery system applied to online shopping. My project idea is to create a mobile application to support a service that streamlines the delivery of online purchases directly to consumers. As an online shopper, you will be able to purchase items, such as clothes, stationery, bathroom essentials and other easy-to-package products, from select stores around your area and someone will be able to deliver this to you within the hour.
      </p>
      <h4><i>Motivation</i></h4>
      <p style='text-align: justify'>
        While many of us already use food and liquor delivery services, there is a shortage of courier services offering the same for online shopping. Even in terms of existing courier services, these usually take at least three hours to deliver. It appears that whilst online shopping trends have taken off, delivery services are still in need of catching up.
      </p>
      <p style='text-align: justify'>
        Statista recently published results from their survey:
        <br><br>
        <i>‘As internet access and adoption are rapidly increasing worldwide, the number of digital buyers keeps climbing every year. In 2019, an estimated 1.92 billion people purchased goods or services online, and during the same year, e-retail sales surpassed 3.5 trillion U.S. dollars worldwide’ (Coppola 2021, para. 1).</i>
      </p>
      <p style='text-align: justify'>
        Similarly, the Australian context is no exception:
        <br><br>
        <i>‘We are in an interesting position within Australia. Ecommerce orders were on the rise due to safety concerns of shopping instore and lockdowns issued across Australian states at the start of 2020…and despite this demand, delivery networks are struggling to keep up’ (Comestri 2021, p. 6).</i>
      </p>
      <p style='text-align: justify'>
        As the proposed idea will have humble beginnings, it will only be able to address the efficiency in the surrounding area of the consumer. However, it is nevertheless a start, and will contribute towards satisfying online-purchasing demands, supporting local businesses, and addressing safety concerns especially given our current context.
      </p>
      <h4><i>Description</i></h4>
      <p style='text-align: justify'>
        <u>Streamlined</u>:
      </p>
      <p style='text-align: justify'>
        This app would simply give a new dimension to B2C services and mobile apps. It will be a one-stop-shop for a multitude of products, so long as they can be safely transported by a courier. It will increase efficiency, support local businesses and jobs, whilst allowing consumers to contribute to the economy from the convenience of their living room.
      </p>
      <p style='text-align: justify'>
        <u>Simple</u>:
      </p>
      <p style='text-align: justify'>
        A user-friendly interface that makes it easy for users to scroll through a selection of stores in their area, to then select from a variety of products from that store, combined with a clear check-out process that takes secure online transactions.
      </p>
      <p style='text-align: justify'>
        The app will also need to be designed in a way that is simple for businesses to use. A logistical challenge here is that the app will need to address the amount of data that will have to be stored due to the large number of items that shops may want to include. This can partly be solved by adding a feature that caps the number of items that each store can list. Through a subscriber model, each business can choose data packages based on different price levels.
      </p>
      <p style='text-align: justify'>
        Due to the familiarity with similar delivery applications, most users will already be somewhat adept at most of the features and processes. The app will be structured around maps and filters which will allow the user to select stores based on what products or services they are interested in, within a given radius. However, that is not to say it can’t also be unique!
      </p>
      <p style='text-align: justify'>
        <u>Smart</u>:
      </p>
      <p style='text-align: justify'>
        Real-time geolocation tracking of the order. This feature has been widely used by food delivery services and essentially allows the consumer to track the product in real time, by visually identifying on the map where the courier is at any given time. This allows both the consumer and the business to plan their time and resources.
      </p>
      <p style='text-align: justify'>
        The idea would be that the drivers be ready in strategic locations to allow them to pick up the order instantly and deliver it. An efficient notification system will need to be implemented to allow for both the couriers and the stores to prepare and deliver the products as quickly as possible.
      </p>
      <p style='text-align: justify'>
        <u>Safe</u>:
      </p>
      <p style='text-align: justify'>
        Safety has been a key topic since the start of the pandemic and has taken new central role in the dynamics of urban societies. City and shopping centres are empty because consumers are scared of cramping within restricted spaces. The contactless delivery and instant delivery of products allows for the transaction of goods and service to continue within a safe space, supporting both businesses and consumers.
      </p>
      <p style='text-align: justify'>
        It is impossible to separate consumerism and capitalism from the inevitable effect it has on the environment. This app seeks to have a positive effect on the environment by decreasing the amount of travelling that consumers would have to undertake to shop for products.
      </p>
      <p style='text-align: justify'>
        <u>Support</u>:
      </p>
      <p style='text-align: justify'>
        Business and customer support either listed somewhere easy to find or integrated into the design.
      </p>
      <h4><i>Tools & Technologies</i></h4>
      <p style='text-align: justify'>
        In order to create the app and design the basic interface, the programming software required to do this will depend on the language we choose to adopt. For example, the most often used language for designing an app for android devices is Java (BuildFire n.d.a), which we would then use Eclipse IDE to develop and edit our code. Additionally, there are programs specifically designed for building apps such as Android Studio for android (BuildFire n.d.a).
      </p>
      <p style='text-align: justify'>
        We will also need do some unit testing called Test-Driven Development, to test and debug the program as we go. Some options include PyTest for Python, Quick for iOS, or Karma for Javascript (Codementor 2015).
      </p>
      <p style='text-align: justify'>
        Perhaps the most challenging part of this project is the integration of additional features or functions, depending on how many we wish to include. A particularly important feature is that the app relies heavily on tracking a geolocation for a device. For geolocation, there are two main ways to integrate this: (1) Internet IP address (2) GPS device; the second option is device dependent and requires a lot more work than the first (Dwyer 2019).  For this reason, and to make things simpler, programming in Python could be a solid option as we can more easily learn the language and link IP address data (IPinfo n.d.).
      </p>
      <p style='text-align: justify'>
        Furthermore, we may need to have a thorough understanding of data storage so that there might be an option for tracking and updating stock levels for any given online store. We will need to look into creating a cloud-based server as well as the associated back-end processes (Buildfire n.d.b).
      </p>
      <h4><i>Skills Required</i></h4>
      <p style='text-align: justify'>
        Essentially, the feasibility of this project will depend on how complex we want the app to be and how dedicated the team is to the idea, acknowleding the fact that a lot of work will be required from each of us to accomplish and submit the final product. That being said, if everyone is up for it, based on the skills we currently have the project is indeed ambitious but doable within the given timeframe if we plan strategically, distribute the workload, and structure our learning and programming accordingly (BuildFire n.d.a). We will need to: (1) list down the core functions, (2) do a rough sketch of the app’s user interface, (3) plan the UI flow, (4) design the backend - the database, (5) then design the front-end otherwise called UX wireframes (Codementor 2015).
      </p>
      <p style='text-align: justify'>
        Given that it is <u>A LOT</u> of work for an introductory course, and that most of the team also have full-time jobs, another option is to scale the project down to a more manageable size, and to simply create a <u>prototype</u> that we may then wish to further develop at a later stage.
      </p>
      <h4><i>Outcome</i></h4>
      <p style='text-align: justify'>
        Traditional online shopping can be somewhat of a dull experience. When buying online you can often feel detached from the item until you receive it which can often take days or weeks. Through this app, the real-time nature of the shopping experience will allow consumers to form an immediate bond with the product as it makes its way (on the map) to their homes. If the project is successful, it will present an efficient solution to the influx of deliverables, as well as reimagine and improve the overall experience of online shopping.
